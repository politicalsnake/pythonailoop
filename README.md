This is a school project
It is mostly finished

What its for - 
  Writing Python programs with AI, with an emphasis on the output being high quality through revision

How it works - 
  The code uses the Gemini AI Python API to write and revise Python programs and achieves high-quality output.

What it does - 
  The code will create, then revise a program based on an initial prompt. The program will automatically create the Python program files it writes, and then run them. DON'T TELL IT TO WRITE A PROGRAM YOU DON'T WANT TO RUN... CUZ IT WILL.

Run in a Python3 terminal - you need a Gemini API key, which you can get for free.
